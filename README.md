# Dargus Antivirus - Python GUI Application

Welcome to Dargus Antivirus, an endpoint security application developed purely in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The program incorporates the Pillow library to enhance the overall design, allowing the inclusion of images seamlessly into the GUI.
