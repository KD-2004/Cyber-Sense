 # Cyber Sense - Python GUI Application

Welcome to Dargus Antivirus, an endpoint security application developed purely in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The program incorporates the Pillow library to enhance the overall design, allowing the inclusion of images seamlessly into the GUI.

## Features




## Page 1: Welcome

Upon starting the program, you will be greeted by the first page, limited to a resolution of 1270x720p for consistent viewing across different devices. The main elements on this page include:

- **Navigation Bar:** Easily switch between pages.
- **App Name:** Displayed on top for easy identification.
- **Illustrated Panel:** Designed using Adobe Illustrator, adding a visually appealing touch.
- **Real-Time Reports:** Monitor RAM and CPU usage using the `psutil` library.
- **Inactive Buttons:** Placeholder buttons without assigned functions.
